# Project Glossary
**Nominal Interest Rate:**
It refers to the interest rate before taking inflation into account.\
**Inflation:**
It is the rate of increase in prices over given period of time.\
**Real Interest Rate:**
It referes to the interest that is adjusted to remove the effects of inflation.\
Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation \
**Yield Curve:**
It is a graph that plots yields, or interest rates, of bonds that have equal credit quality but differing maturity dates.\
**Weiner Process (Brownian Motion):**
It is a real-values continuous time stochastic process. Generally, it is denoted by W_t and is characterized by following properties:\
1. W_0 = 0 
2. W has independet increments, i.e., W_{t+u} - W_t, u \geq 0 is independent of W_s for s<t 
3. W has Gaussian increments, i.e., W_{t+u} - W_t, u \approx \mathbb(N) (0,\mu) 
4. W_t is almost surely continuous in t.\

**Risk-Neutral Measure:**

**Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process:**
